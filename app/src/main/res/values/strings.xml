		<p><b>PRIMIR</b></p>
		<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
		<p><b>Brief Background</b></p>
		<p><b>Urdaneta City University (UCU)</b> stated as a rewarding
	concept of Dr. Pedro T. Orata, world renowned educator and a
	Ramon Magsaysay awardee to establish an educational complex
	that will provide basic education all the way through higher
	education in a single compound.Its humble beginning contrasts
	its current status as a fast growing and one local college in
	the province of Pangasinan.It started maximizing available
	resources to provide education to knowledge-hungry youth and
	young adults,believing on the principle of EDUCATION FOR ALL!	</p>
		<p>Indeed, as the first community college in the Philippines,
	UCU formerly known as Urdaneta City University (UCU) is a concrete
	and genuine proof of Dr. Oratas solid expression of his great love,
	faith and concern for the poor but capable and deserving Filipino
	youth who cannot afford collegiate schooling in the cities.Believing
	that the rural people are entitled to equal opportunities for and
	access to higher education with those in the cities, he founded the
	UCC in 1966 with mayor Amadeo R. Perez Jr. and with the strong support
	of the Sangguniang Bayan using the proceeds of the 1966 Town Fiesta
	celebration. Noteworthy was the contribution of Dr.Leoncio Ancheta,
	first Dean of UCC who assisted of Dr.Orata in laying the groundwork
	for the Colleges formal operations.As an archetypal of the community
	colleges of United States of America (USA), the College started with
	an enrolment of one hundred forty-four (144) students, who came from the
	rural areas.</p>
		<p>Apparently, most of the first students earned their way through
	college by driving tricycles before and after classes, working in the
	farms, serving as part-time maids and salesladies.</p>
		<p>The College commenced its operation with the provisional permit
	to open a two-year General Education course granted by the Secretary of
	Education on February 4, 1966. The Secretary further approved the program for Non-formal
	Education; hence, short-term courses in agriculture and retail business for adults were
	also offered to assist them in enhancing their earning capabilities.</p>
		<p>After two years, the first batch of General Education, 84 members, graduated.
	This paved the way to the opening of a four-year Education program which was granted in 1968.</p>
		<p>Adhering to the philosophy of keeping pace with the changing needs in the academe,
	UCC offered degrees in Nursing in 1975, Commerce and Accountancy and Computer education in 1996.
	It also introduced in its course offering short-term courses in Midwifery (1973), Computer
	Education (1990) and Caregiver Training Program (2002).</p>
		<p>Undoubtedly, the College is a unique institution. While it is a higher
	learning institution of the Urdaneta City, it remains self-sufficient to a steady growth. During
	its infancy, the facilities of the Urdaneta Community High School now known as Urdaneta City National High
	School (UCNHS) were utilized for its operation. This was based on Dr. Orata\'s principle of resource
	maximization and not to wait and stay idle while government is contemplating the provision of basic
	services. Otherwise, school children and public high school students in very remote places all over
	the country might be waiting until doomsday for a chance to go to school or to continue their schooling.</p>
		<p>As the first community college in the country, UCC proved its worth despite its limited
	resources. Many times, the College managed to be one of the top performing higher learning institutions
	in the field of education, nursing and midwifery not to mention the high rate of board passers for the
	past few years. With this, it continues to attract students as far as Abra, Aurora, Isabela, Ilocos,
	Nueva Vizcaya, Tarlac, Quezon, Mt. Province, Pampanga and other neighboring provinces.</p>
		<p>When Urdaneta became a city on March 21, 1998, UCC likewise recognized the need to adopt
	a new name. Consequently, in 2001, Mayor Amadeo R. Perez, Jr. broadened the school\'s educational
	services and changed its name to City College of Urdaneta by virtue of Sangguniang Panlungsod
	Resolution No. 61 which took effect on November 2001. In 2005, the name was further amended as the
	City Colleges of Urdaneta. From the time of its birth up to present the College continues to serve
	as a reservoir and source of manpower needs for the city, nearby towns and for neighbouring provinces.</p>
		<p>On January 13, 2004, CCU became the first Character School in Region I, inculcating in its
	students the need, not just for academic excellence, but more importantly, character transformation.</p>
		<p>With four (4) decades of service, UCU now boasts of an enrolment of more than 6,000 students.
	From the borrowed classrooms, the College has now expanded to seven buildings. A newly-refurbished library,
	student centers, a multi-media library, and renovated rooms are just some of the features that UCU could now
	lay claim to. As the only local university in the province where people can avail an inexpensive tertiary
	education the University is located in San Vicente West, Urdaneta City on a one and a half (1.5) hectare of
	land which continue to expand with seven (7) academic buildings catering to varied curricular programs of the
	five (5) colleges. As a local university it continues to serve significantly as a potent source for the labor market.</p>
		<p>In February 7, 2005 a major breakthrough happened when the Sangguniang Panlungsod of the Urdaneta
	re-established the College by approving CITY ORDINANCE NO. 37-2005, to wit: AN ORDINANCE CONFIRMING THE CHARTER
	OF THE CITY COLLEGES OF URDANETA AND REVISING PARTS THEREOF TO SUIT THE CHANGES, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES
	thus strengthening the College foundation and incorporating thereto various changes to cope with
	the fast changing times.</p>
		<p>Indeed, Dr. Oratas philosophy of providing equal educational opportunities for all and Mayor Perezs action for reform
	and progress thru delivery of educational have taken root and their vision of academic excellence continues
	to live on as CCU continues to expand as an educational institution, keeping the flame of EDUCATION raging.</p>
